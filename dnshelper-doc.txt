Kev’s DNS Helper - Training Manual

Welcome!  
Kev’s DNS Helper is a simple command-line tool designed to help you quickly perform common DNS and WHOIS lookups. Whether you’re troubleshooting a domain, exploring mail server records, or just learning how DNS works, this tool provides a clear, user-friendly interface.

What Does It Do?

- DNS Lookup (A Records): Find the IP addresses associated with a domain name.
- MX Lookup: Identify which mail servers handle email for a domain.
- NS Lookup: Find the authoritative name servers for a domain.
- SOA Lookup: Retrieve the Start of Authority record, which shows details about the domain’s DNS zone.
- Reverse DNS Lookup: Given an IP address, find its associated domain name (if any).
- WHOIS Lookup: Retrieve registration details about the domain (like registrar and creation date).
- Get All Information: Run all of the above lookups at once for a domain.
- Zone Transfer Attempt: Try to transfer the domain’s entire DNS zone for debugging or educational purposes (note: most servers will not allow this for security reasons).

How to Use the Tool

1. Run the Program  
   Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux), navigate to the directory containing the script, and run:
   ```bash
   python3 dnshelper.py
   ```
   *Note:* The script name may differ depending on how you saved it.

2. View the Main Menu  
   After launching, you’ll see a decorative ASCII banner and a menu of options numbered 1 through 9.

3. Choose an Option  
   Simply type the number of the action you want to take and press Enter. For example, to perform a DNS lookup, type:
   ```  
   1  
   ```
   and press Enter.

4. Enter the Domain or IP as Requested  
   The tool will prompt you for a domain name (like `example.com`) or an IP address (like `8.8.8.8`) depending on the chosen function.
   
   Tip: Ensure that the domain format is correct (for example, `google.com` is valid; `google..com` or just `google` is not).  
   For IP addresses, make sure you enter a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.

5. View the Results  
   The tool will display the results in a neat, tabulated format. For instance, DNS lookups will show a list of IP addresses, and WHOIS lookups will show registrar, creation date, and other useful details.

6. Continue or Exit  
   After viewing the results, you’ll return to the main menu. You can:
   - Perform another lookup by choosing another menu option.
   - Exit the tool by selecting option 9.

 Error Handling & Troubleshooting

- Invalid Input: If you type in a domain that doesn’t exist or format something incorrectly, the tool will let you know.

- DNS/WHOIS Errors: Occasionally, lookups may fail due to server issues, firewall restrictions, or non-existent records. If this happens, you’ll see a friendly error message. Just try a different domain or check your network connection.

- Zone Transfer Issues: Don’t be surprised if zone transfers fail. Most servers block them for security reasons. It’s normal!

 Tips & Best Practices

- Experiment and Learn: Try running WHOIS lookups on different domains to see how registration details vary across different top-level domains.
- Compare DNS Records: Use DNS, MX, and NS lookups to understand a domain’s configuration. For example, see if changing a domain’s nameserver updates the returned data after a few hours.
- Combine Lookups: The “Get All Information” option (7) is a quick way to get a snapshot of all the important details about a domain, including DNS and WHOIS data.

 Safety and Security

- No Sensitive Data Collected: The tool doesn’t store your queries; it just performs lookups and shows you the results.

- Validate Your Inputs: The tool checks that you enter well-formed domains and valid IP addresses to prevent errors and potential security issues.

- Logging Errors: Behind the scenes, errors are logged securely for debugging purposes, without exposing unnecessary details to the user.
